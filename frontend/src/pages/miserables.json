The Fed's forecasts published in March suggest that would mark the end of rate hikes for the Fed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Many economists, including Brusuelas, suspect this will indeed come to pass for the central bank. Brusuelas wrote, \"it is now appropriate to begin considering a 'one and done' policy path at the Federal Reserve.\"</p> \n<p>Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic wrote Friday the March jobs report \"is supportive of another rate hike in May — which we think could be the last for the tightening cycle. Followed by a long pause.\"</p> \n<p>Over at Wells Fargo, economists Sarah House and Michael Pugliese wrote Friday, \"On balance, this is the type of employment report we believe policymakers at the FOMC want to see: job growth slowing in an orderly fashion, labor supply expanding and wage growth that is edging closer to rates that are consistent with the central bank's 2% inflation target.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The firm expects a rate hike in May, \"but it could be the last rate hike of the cycle as policymakers keep rates on hold for an extended period of time and let the medicine take.\"</p> \n<div id=\"080ccaa8415b4c0d87d7977ca3c2ec04\"></div> \n<p>Indicators like a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-125027571.html\">rise in initial jobless claims</a>, a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/job-opening-data-jolts-powell-fed-better-balance-170515210.html\">drop in open job listings</a>, and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.challengergray.com/blog/job-cuts-rise-15-in-march-2023-up-319-from-same-month-last-year-highest-q1-since-2020/\">layoff increases</a> captured by Challenger Gray's monthly report all suggest a slowing in the labor market — and the economy — that is consistent with the Fed being able to back off its rate hikes.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And yet the notion that the economy is finally matching the Fed's goal is one that has been simmering in markets for months.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Only to be swatted away by the data at each turn.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In late 2022, an economic slowdown seemed in the offing as monthly job gains fell below 300,000 from September through December.

On March 22, the Fed raised rates another 0.25%.</p> \n<p>After <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-surge-to-cap-first-quarter-rally-stock-market-news-today-200210736.html\">inflation data that, like labor market data, is cooling but remains elevated</a> and Friday's strong jobs report, the market is expecting another rate hike next month.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And so while economists are again circling the idea that now, finally, in this moment we're ready to see the Fed pause, little over the last six months has suggested the U.S. economy is ready to put the Fed in position to back off.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some in markets will chide the Powell Fed for having been consistently wrong in their economic forecasts. Another bout of revisions to chase reality in 2023 would not silence these critics.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But being wrong about the outlook has not stopped Powell &amp; co. from acting on new information. And the notion that this Fed's reaction function might change now could see investors again fall into the same trap all over again.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/topic/stock-market-news/\"><strong>Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks</strong></a></p> \n<p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/\"><strong>Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance</strong></a></p>",

The more than $45 billion decrease in the latest week was primarily due to a a drop in loans by small banks.</p>\n<p>The pullback in total lending in the last half of March was broad and included fewer real estate loans, as well as commercial and industrial loans.</p>\n<p>Friday’s report also showed commercial bank deposits dropped $64.7 billion in the latest week, marking the 10th-straight decrease that mainly reflected a decline at large firms.</p>\n<p>The slide in lending follows the collapse of several firms including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.</p>\n<p>Economists are closely monitoring the Fed’s so-called H.8 report, which provides an estimated weekly aggregate balance sheet for all commercial banks in the US, to gauge credit conditions. The recent bank failures have complicated the central bank’s efforts to reduce inflation without sending the economy into a recession.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the American Bankers Association index of credit conditions fell to the lowest level since the onset of the pandemic, indicating bank economists see credit conditions weakening over the next six months. As a result, banks are likely to become more cautious about extending credit.</p>\n<p>The banking crisis has made a recession more likely, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s Jamie Dimon. The bank’s chief executive officer said in an annual letter that the failures have “provoked lots of jitters in the market and will clearly cause some tightening of financial conditions as banks and other lenders become more conservative.”</p>\n<p>The Fed’s report showed that by bank size, lending decreased $23.5 billion at the 25 largest domestically chartered banks in the latest two weeks, and plunged $73.6 billion at smaller commercial banks over the same period. Lending by foreign institutions in the US fell $7.5 billion.</p>\n<p>The biggest 25 domestic banks account for almost three-fifths of lending, although in some key areas — including commercial real estate — smaller banks are the most important providers of credit.</p>\n<p>In a note on the report, the Fed said domestically chartered banks made divestments to nonbank institutions that affected $60 billion in loans in the week ended March 22, meaning those loans are no longer held by commercial lenders.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, so-called “other” deposits, which exclude large time deposits, have fallen $260.8 billion at commercial banks since the week ended March 15. At domestically chartered banks, they declined $236 billion, mostly reflecting a drop at the 25 largest institutions. Deposits at small banks fell $58.1 billion.</p>\n<p>Two-Week Changes:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Commercial and industrial lending — considered a closely followed gauge of economic activity — fell $68 billion</li>\n <li>Commercial real estate loans dropped $35.3 billion</li>\n <li>Total assets, which includes vault cash, as well as balances due from depository institutions and the Fed, decreased nearly $220 billion</li>\n <li>Total liabilities declined more than $188 billion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Fed’s report on assets and liabilities of commercial banks includes breakdowns of credit by destination — such as consumer, real estate and commercial loans — as well as categories based on bank size.</p>\n<p>For a list of banks commercial banks ranked by assets, click here.</p>\n<p>The H.8 release is primarily based on data that are reported weekly by a sample domestically chartered banks and foreign-related institutions.</p>\n<p>--With assistance from Benjamin Purvis and Reade Pickert.</p>\n<p>(Adds transfer to non-bank institutions)</p>\n<p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-04-06/anthony-scaramucci-s-skybridge-capital-woes-predate-ftx?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital Was Spiraling, and Then Came FTX</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-04-06/what-to-do-with-my-money-a-guide-to-2023-investing?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">What to Do With Your Money—and Your Life—in a Wild New World</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-05/inside-apple-s-plan-to-move-iphone-production-from-china-to-india?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Apple’s Complex, Secretive Gamble to Move Beyond China</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-05/xi-jinping-launches-charm-offensive-to-repair-china-s-image?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Xi Jinping Launches a Charm Offensive to Repair China’s Tattered Image</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-04-05/russia-war-in-ukraine-boosts-german-defense-industry-profits?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Thanks to Putin, Business Is&nbsp;Booming for Germany’s Defense Contractors</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>©2023 Bloomberg L.P.</p>",

Gavin Newsom declaring last month the state was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-governor-newsom-walgreens-abortion-pill-080489daa45a981f2da140a2a56ee25b\">done doing business with the pharmacy</a> giant after it indicated it would not sell abortion pills by mail in some states.</p> \n<p>“California won’t be doing business with @Walgreens -- or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women’s lives at risk. We’re done,” Newsom tweeted March 6. </p> \n<p>He then ordered his administration not to renew a $54 million contract with the company to provide prescription medication to the state's prison system.</p> \n<p>But cutting ties with Walgreens wasn't as clear cut as the governor first indicated. Walgreens has a much more lucrative connection to California's Medicaid program — the joint federal and state health insurance program for people who are disabled or have low incomes. Federal law says Medicaid patients have the right to fill prescriptions from any willing and qualified provider. </p> \n<p>That includes Walgreens. </p> \n<p>Last year, California's Medicaid program paid the company more than $1.5 billion. The California Department of Health Care Services said California will continue to comply with that law, <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/article/gov-newsom-wanted-california-to-cut-ties-with-walgreens-then-federal-law-got-in-the-way/\">Kaiser Health News reported</a>. </p> \n<p>“California has no intention of taking any action that would violate federal Medicaid requirements, or that could undermine access for low-income individuals,” said Tony Cava, spokesman for the California Department of Health Care Services. </p> \n<p>Anthony York, spokesman for the governor, also told Kaiser Health News that the Newsom administration had invited Walgreens to apply again for the $54 million contract the state chose not to renew last month.</p> \n<p>“Tweeting is not policy,” York told the news outlet.</p> \n<p>York said Friday the Walgreens contract was not renewed but that the company \"may seek future procurement opportunities.”</p> \n<p>This is not the first time Newsom has made a splashy announcement without first working out all of the details behind it. At the beginning of the pandemic, the Newsom administration quickly signed a contract to purchase masks and other personal protective equipment, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sacramento-health-us-news-virus-outbreak-gavin-newsom-3d6b9c48746f91c00adf134070a80849\">frustrating some lawmakers</a> who did not know the details.</p> \n<p>“This is something that politicians bump up against all the time,\" said Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University who focuses on politics and elections. “They want to say something strong and big and bold and splashy, and the devil is in the legal details.” </p> \n<p>Newsom's spat with Walgreens began after the company indicated it <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pill-walgreens-mifepristone-fd2663ace286c3c48b9c66a74c652ef4\">would not distribute</a> abortion pills by mail in some conservative states. That pill, mifepristone, when combined with another pill, will end a pregnancy. It's been approved since 2000 in the U.S. for use up to the 10th week of pregnancy. Today, more than half of all abortions in the U.S. are done this way, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.</p> \n<p>Several states have taken steps to restrict mifepristone, after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down federal abortion protections last year. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/abortion-missouri-state-government-west-virginia-united-states-us-food-and-drug-administration-a1b1a387788bb5aaa39c9ce4128d77ab\">attorneys general in 20 states</a>, mostly with Republican governors, warned Walgreens it could face legal consequences if it distributed mifepristone in their states. Walgreens responded by saying it would not distribute mifepristone in states where it is not legal to do so. </p> \n<p>On Friday, Walgreens spokesperson Fraser Engerman referred questions to Newsom's office. But Engerman reiterated the company's position about abortion pills.</p> \n<p>“Walgreens plans to dispense mifepristone in any jurisdiction where it is legally permissible to do so,” Engerman said. “Once we are certified by the FDA, we will dispense this medication consistent with federal and state laws. Providing legally approved medications to patients is what pharmacies do, and is rooted in our commitment to the communities in which we operate.”</p> \n<p>Newsom's former chief of staff, Ann O'Leary, represented Walgreens in discussions with the Newsom administration over the issue last month, Politico reported.</p>",

To get a sense of how that plays out, think if it as 1x your [current] income by age 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, and 8x by 60, she added.</p> \n<p>Those who can’t afford to increase their savings rate to the recommended 15% should just get started, even if it is a small amount. Bumping your retirement savings up 1% more each year can have a “tremendous impact in the long term,” she said. The math: For a household making $60,000, 1% equals saving an extra $50 a month. “That could translate into an additional $270 of monthly retirement income with compound interest and market growth,” Assaf said.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/50831ee0-d54a-11ed-addf-bec28d3956f6\" alt=\"Fidelity's 2023 Retirement Savings Assessment\" data-uuid=\"ed2b7011-741e-3407-b470-ae8a3d039f0c\">\n <figcaption>\n  Fidelity's 2023 Retirement Savings Assessment\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Fidelity's 2023 Retirement Savings Assessment\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>And if you are considering changing jobs this year, steer clear of the temptation to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/efforts-to-keep-workers-from-cashing-out-their-401-ks-gain-steam-181832994.html\">cash out some or all of your retirement accounts</a> — something 41.4% of <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mksc.2022.1404\">workers between 2014 and 2016 did</a>.

That’s based on just over 62.9 million refunds the agency has disbursed this year versus nearly 63.4 million refunds sent out last year.</p> \n<p>Since the beginning of this tax season, the average refund has come in lower than last year's based on the weekly filing statistics, underscoring how the loss of several pandemic-era tax breaks has translated to a smaller, key windfall for many American households.</p> \n<p>“This year, the biggest change was the Child Tax Credit being lowered back to the normal amount,” Rus Garofalo, founder and president of <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://brasstaxes.com/\">BrassTaxes</a>, told Yahoo Finance.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-01/9dba96e0-9c63-11ed-bab7-a7bc4fda4664\" style=\"height:4000px;width:6000px;\" alt=\"Tax Return form 1040 with USA America flag and dollar banknote, U.S. Individual Income.\" data-uuid=\"1bf99cc4-cd02-31a2-be75-6c3446a689ad\">\n <figcaption>\n  Credit: Getty Images\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  sasirin pamai via Getty Images\n </div>\n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Loss of pandemic breaks</strong></h2> \n<p>The average refund last year was 14.3% more than in 2021, with the increase largely due to temporary enhancements to the Child Tax Credit (CTC), Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and Child and Dependent Care Credit. Those credit amounts are now back to pre-COVID levels.</p> \n<p>For example, the CTC declined to $2,000 per child dependent versus $3,600 last year. It’s also not fully refundable anymore, meaning taxpayers won’t receive the full credit if it exceeds the amount of tax they paid — a change that hurts the lowest-earning families the most.</p> \n<p>The maximum EITC amount that single filers with no children are eligible for is $500 this year. Last tax season, these filers got as much as $1,502 for the credit, which also had a higher income threshold then.</p> \n<p>The Child and Dependent Care Credit — which covers out-of-pocket expenses for child care and day camps — was reduced this year to $2,100 compared with last year’s $8,000.</p> \n<p>The loss of the above-the-line charitable deduction and the expiration of the mortgage insurance premium deduction also could factor into lower refunds.</p> \n<h2><strong>A smoother tax season</strong></h2> \n<p>Of the 168 million individual tax returns the IRS expects this year, the agency has received 90.1 million so far, almost on track with the nearly 91.3 million received last year at this time.</p> \n<p>The IRS also appears to be on top of the returns coming in. As of March 31, the agency had processed over almost 89.7 million tax returns, or 99.5% of those received. Slightly more taxpayers are also e-filing their returns and choosing direct deposit for their refunds, heeding the agency’s earlier advice to get a faster refund.</p> \n<p>Another sign that it’s been a relatively smoother tax season this year? Visits to the IRS website are down 17.4% versus last year.</p> \n<p><em>Gabriella Cruz-Martinez contributed to the article.</em></p> \n<p><em>Ronda is a personal finance senior reporter for Yahoo Finance and attorney with experience in law, insurance, education, and government.

Results for the quarter that ended on March 31 are expected to be reported on April 28. </p> \n<p> Pioneer, the third-largest producer of oil after Chevron Corp and ConocoPhillips in the top U.S. shale basin, denied a media report six weeks ago that it was considering an acquisition of smaller rival Range Resources Corp . </p> \n<p> It said at the time that it was \"not contemplating a significant business combination or other acquisition transaction.\" </p> \n<p> (Reporting by Shivani Tanna and Jaiveer Shekhawat in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Sabrina Valle in Houston and Liz Hampton in Denver; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Bill Berkrot) </p>",

        "content": "<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — This Easter, Americans will devour more than 1 billion Peeps — those radiant marshmallow chicks whose appearance on store shelves each year is as much a herald of spring as azaleas at <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/the-masters\">the Masters</a>.</p> \n<p>What makes the treats so vibrant is erythrosine, a chemical that shows up on ingredient labels as Red No. 3. It's one of several chemicals, along with titanium dioxide, used to color some of the most popular candy in the country — including Skittles and Hot Tamales.</p> \n<p>Both chemicals have been linked to cancer. More than 30 years ago, U.S. regulators <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/83322a29c173c2756755c0a2e9311064\">banned Red No. 3 from makeup</a>. The U.S. still has not banned the chemical from food, to the dismay of some consumer safety groups.</p> \n<p>Now, a state lawmaker wants to ban erythrosine and titanium dioxide in California, plus three other chemicals used in everyday favorites like tortillas and some store brand sodas.</p> \n<p>The bill, scheduled for its first public hearing next week, has prompted headlines around the world declaring California wants to ban Skittles and other candy. Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat who authored the bill, said he wants to ban the chemicals, not the candy. He said plenty of alternative ingredients are available, noting the chemicals are already banned in Europe and that companies still find a way to sell candy there.</p> \n<p>“They still produce Skittles in other parts of the world. What they do is they take out these toxic ingredients, and they replace them with something else,” Gabriel said. “What we really want is for these companies to make the same minor modifications to their recipes that they made in Europe and elsewhere.”</p> \n<p>The National Confectioners Association, the trade group that represents candy companies, says it's not that easy. Tastes vary across cultures, it said, meaning just because a candy is accepted by Europeans doesn't mean it will be received well in the United States. Plus, changing ingredients would be a hardship for regional candy makers who don't sell their products overseas, according to the trade group.</p> \n<p>“There's a lot more here at play than a simple soundbite solution,” said Christopher Gindlesperger, spokesperson for the association. “We need a comprehensive look at this to make sure there aren't unintended consequences for chocolate and candy companies.”</p> \n<p>In addition to erythrosine and titanium dioxide, the bill would ban potassium bromate and propylparaben, two chemicals used in baked goods, and brominated vegetable oil, which is used in some store brand sodas.</p> \n<p>The U.S. has allowed dyes like erythrosine in food since 1907. Decades later, researchers found rats exposed to lots of erythrosine over a long time developed thyroid cancer. In 1990, based in part off of that research, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned erythrosine from cosmetics.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Consumer safety groups have tried for years to get the agency to ban the chemical in food to no avail. Researchers have since linked the chemical to other health problems besides cancer, including hyperactivity and other neurobiological behaviors in some children, according to a 2021 report from the California Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.</p> \n<p>The International Association of Color Manufacturers argued in a 2021 statement that California study was “based on insufficient scientific evidence.”</p> \n<p>Titanium dioxide is a white powder that, because it scatters light, can make colors appear brighter. It's been used for 100 years in products like paints, paper, rubber, toothpaste, soap and food coloring. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has listed titanium dioxide as a possible carcinogen in humans. The Titanium Dioxide Manufacturers Association maintains there is no evidence of it causing cancer in humans.</p> \n<p>The candy industry insists the chemicals California is considering banning “have been thoroughly reviewed by the federal and state systems and many international scientific bodies and continue to be deemed safe,” according to a letter signed by various industry trade groups.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“These scientifically based regulatory processes should be allowed to continue without second guessing their outcomes,” the letter stated.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/76983160-d57c-11ed-8bff-b2c8e13e1ea6\" style=\"height:2808px;width:4212px;\" alt=\"In this Wednesday, Feb. 13, 2013 photo, displayed are Peeps at the Just Born factory in Bethlehem, Pa.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  ASSOCIATED PRESS\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Scott Faber, senior vice president for governmental affairs for the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said the only reason the chemical is still deemed safe by federal regulators is because of a loophole that has been exploited by chemical companies. He says regulators have not reviewed their prior decisions in light of new science.</p> \n<p>“The confectioners and the food industry know the review process at the FDA is broken. They have been hiding behind it for decades. We shouldn't let them hide behind it anymore,\" Faber said. “If FDA won’t fix this review system and keep us safe from dangerous chemicals in our food, it’s up to states like California to keep us safe.”</p> \n<p>Just Born Inc., the Pennsylvania-based company that makes Peeps, said in a statement the company complies with FDA regulations and gets their “ingredients and packaging exclusively from reputable suppliers who adhere to high quality and safety standards.”</p> \n<p>The company noted its development team is looking for other options, “including colors derived form natural sources that can deliver the same visual impact and stability as their certified counterparts.”</p> \n<p>___</p> \n<p>Daley reported from San Francisco.</p>",

The reduction was 40% higher, according to the Energy Ministry data.</p>\n<p>Eight members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, including de facto leader Saudi Arabia, agreed to join the voluntary cuts from May, bringing the total reductions to more than 1.6 million barrels per day in an effort to stabilize the global market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The surprise decision drove an oil rally and set the stage for crude prices returning to $100 per barrel.</p>\n<p>Russia will cut its crude-only output using February’s production as the baseline, according to Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. Bloomberg calculations based on industry data put that month’s production at 10.1 million barrels a day.</p>\n<p>The Energy Ministry data say producers pumped a daily average of 1.285 million tons of crude, the person said, asking not to be identified because the figures aren’t public.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That’s equivalent to just over 9.4 million barrels, meaning crude-only cuts totaled nearly 700,000 barrels a day last month.</p>\n<p>The nation’s total March production of crude oil and condensate averaged 1.413 million tons, the person said. That’s equivalent to 10.36 million barrels per day, compared with 11.1 million barrels in February, according to Bloomberg calculations.</p>\n<p>The resulting total cuts averaged 740,000 barrels a day, the data indicate.</p>\n<p>Russia classified its oil statistics last year due to their “sensitive” nature, making it difficult to assess the implementation of supply cuts beyond the assurances of energy officials.</p>\n<p>As a result, Russia watchers have started following the nation’s seaborne oil exports and domestic oil-processing rates as gauges for crude production estimates. However, both indicators showed no visible declines last month.</p>\n<p>The nation’s four-week average crude loadings through March 31 were at their highest since June, while Russian refineries kept their throughput roughly flat, according to Bloomberg figures based on the nation’s industry data and ship-tracking.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Russia’s Energy Ministry couldn’t immediately comment on the March production data and on what drove the pledged cuts.</p>\n<p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-04-06/anthony-scaramucci-s-skybridge-capital-woes-predate-ftx?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital Was Spiraling, and Then Came FTX</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-04-06/what-to-do-with-my-money-a-guide-to-2023-investing?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">What to Do With Your Money—and Your Life—in a Wild New World</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-05/inside-apple-s-plan-to-move-iphone-production-from-china-to-india?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Apple’s Complex, Secretive Gamble to Move Beyond China</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-05/xi-jinping-launches-charm-offensive-to-repair-china-s-image?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Xi Jinping Launches a Charm Offensive to Repair China’s Tattered Image</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-04-05/russia-war-in-ukraine-boosts-german-defense-industry-profits?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS\">Thanks to Putin, Business Is&nbsp;Booming for Germany’s Defense Contractors</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>©2023 Bloomberg L.P.</p>",

        "content": "<p>DETROIT (AP) — U.S. road safety regulators have sent a team to investigate a crash involving a Tesla that may have been operating on a partially automated driving system when it struck a student who had just exited a school bus.</p> \n<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Friday that it will probe the March 15 crash in Halifax County, North Carolina, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tesla-collision-teenager-injured-north-carolina-69fb66a2d78fdbe006f2220defc69df3\">that injured a 17-year-old student.</a> The State Highway Patrol said the driver of the 2022 Tesla Model Y, a 51-year-old male, failed to stop for the bus, which was displaying all of its activated warning devices.</p> \n<p>Sending special investigation teams to crashes means that the agency suspects the Teslas were operating systems that can handle some aspects of driving, including Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving.” Despite the names, Tesla says these are driver-assist systems and that drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.</p> \n<p>A message was left Friday seeking comment from Tesla.</p> \n<p>Tillman Mitchell, a student at the Haliwa-Saponi Tribal School in Hollister, had just exited the bus and was walking across the street to his house when he was hit, according to the Highway Patrol.</p> \n<p>He was flown to a hospital with life-threatening injuries but was listed in good condition two days after the crash.</p> \n<p>Messages left with the North Carolina State Highway Patrol were not immediately returned Friday. A spokesperson for WakeMed hospital in Raleigh did not immediately provide an update on the student’s condition or indicate whether he had been discharged.</p> \n<p>NHTSA has sent investigative teams to more than 30 crashes since 2016 in which Teslas suspected of operating on Autopilot or “Full Self-Driving” have struck pedestrians, motorcyclists, semi trailers and parked emergency vehicles. At least 14 people were killed in the crashes.</p> \n<p>In March the agency sent a team to a Feb. 18 crash in which a Tesla Model S hit a fire department ladder truck in Contra Costa County, California. The Tesla driver was killed, a passenger was seriously hurt, and four firefighters suffered minor injuries.</p> \n<p>Authorities said the California firetruck had its lights on and was parked diagonally on a highway to protect responders to an earlier accident that did not result in injuries.</p> \n<p>The probes are part of a larger investigation by NHTSA into multiple instances of Teslas using Autopilot crashing into parked emergency vehicles that are tending to other crashes. NHTSA has become more aggressive in pursuing safety problems with Teslas in the past year, announcing multiple recalls and investigations.</p> \n<p>NHTSA is investigating how the Autopilot system detects and responds to emergency vehicles parked on highways. </p> \n<p>The agency wouldn't comment on open investigations, but it has been scrutinizing Teslas more intensely in the past year, seeking several recalls.</p> \n<p>Tesla and NHTSA need to determine why the vehicles don’t seem to see flashing lights on school buses and emergency vehicles and make sure the problem is fixed, said Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety in Washington.</p> \n<p>“I’ve been saying probably for a couple of years now, they need to figure out why these vehicles aren’t recognizing flashing lights for a big starter,” Brooks said. “NHTSA needs to step in and get them to do a recall because that’s a serious safety issue.” </p> \n<p>Earlier this month the agency revealed an investigation of steering wheels that can detach from the steering column on as many as 120,000 Model Y SUVs. It's also investigating seat belts that may not be anchored securely in some Teslas.</p> \n<p>NHTSA also has opened investigations during the past three years into Teslas braking suddenly for no reason, suspension problems and other issues.</p> \n<p>In February, NHTSA pressured Tesla into recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles with “Full Self-Driving” software because the system can break traffic laws. The problem was to be fixed with an online software update. </p> \n<p>The system is being tested on public roads by as many as 400,000 Tesla owners. But NHTSA said in documents that it can make unsafe actions such as traveling straight through an intersection from a turn-only lane, going through a yellow traffic light without proper caution or failing to respond to speed limit changes.</p> \n<p>The U.S. Justice Department also has asked Tesla for documents from Tesla about “Full Self-Driving” and Autopilot.</p> \n<p>____</p> \n<p>Associated Press Writer Hannah Schoenbaum in Raleigh, North Carolina, contributed to this story. </p>",

        "content": "<p>A lot changed when President Trump left the White House in 2021 and President Biden moved in. But one thing didn’t: a protectionist effort to bring more production back to the United States and become less dependent on China.</p> \n<p>Biden’s policy toward China differs from Trump’s, but the goal is the same: To rework supply chains so more crucial goods come from American suppliers and friendly nations and fewer come from China. But economists are starting to warn that this “decoupling” of the two economic powerhouses could backfire and bring more fragility, instead of more self-reliance. Trump's strategy didn't work, and there are now signs that Biden's approach may stumble as well.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump focused on the large U.S. trade deficit with China, slapping tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese imports. By making Chinese imports more expensive, that was supposed to spur more U.S. manufacturing of similar goods, which would face a smaller price disadvantage because of the tariffs or even be cheaper.</p> \n<p>The Trump tariffs didn’t do what they were supposed to: the U.S. trade deficit with China <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-07/us-china-trade-climbs-to-record-in-2022-despite-efforts-to-split#xj4y7vzkg\">hit a new record in 2022</a>, as U.S. importers either ate the higher costs, passed them on to consumers, or found workarounds. But Biden kept the Trump tariffs in place, anyway. Biden counts labor unions as a key constituency, and unions favor protectionist measures that make imports more expensive and give an edge to domestic production.</p> \n<p>Biden has since gone a lot further than Trump, pursuing what economists call “<a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2023/03/06/bidens-big-bet-on-place-based-industrial-policy/\">industrial policy</a>,” or an active government role directing key sectors of the economy. Two bills Biden signed last year, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, include tax breaks and other powerful incentives to bring the manufacturing of semiconductors, electric-vehicle components and many other things back to the United States. Biden has also imposed a new ban on sale of advanced American technology to China, which is more focused on national security than economic competition. That’s meant to prevent China from using advanced semiconductors and other cutting-edge tech in weapons or other systems that could give China a military edge.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-11/f2652080-646d-11ed-bfff-6e079215cbbd\" style=\"height:2240px;width:3360px;\" alt=\"US President Joe Biden (R) and China's President Xi Jinping (L) meet on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Nusa Dua on the Indonesian resort island of Bali on November 14, 2022.

The European Union is developing similar policies, some meant to counter or match Biden’s protectionism. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which led to a remapping of global energy flows, underscores the risks of relying on troublemaker nations for critical supplies.</p> \n<p>But there are risks to protectionism, too, as economists have preached for decades. “The idea of ‘Buy American’ has broad populist appeal,” Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/03/24/economy-trade-united-states-china-industry-manufacturing-supply-chains-biden/\">wrote recently in Foreign Policy</a>. “Yet <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-and-investment-policy-watch/high-taxpayer-cost-saving-us-jobs-through-made-america\">detailed research</a> has repeatedly shown that policies aimed at maximizing domestic manufacturing employment rather than the development and adoption of new technologies are not only doomed to fail but crowd out the very industrial and trade policies that contribute the most to innovation, national security, and decarbonization.”</p> \n<p>The Intl. Monetary Fund <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2023/04/11/world-economic-outlook-april-2023?cid=bl-com-spring2023flagships-WEOEA2023001\">recently warned</a> about the risks of deglobalization, or “slowbalization,” as some people call the flatlining of trade and the decline in cross-border investment that’s been occurring since around 2015. The IMF predicts current trends could eventually cut global output by about 2% over time, with developing nations hurt most but advanced economies such as the United States harmed as well.</p> \n<p>In the United States, both Republicans and Democrats have become China hawks, viewing the U.S.-China relationship as more of a competition than a partnership. This shift occurred during recent years as China <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chinese-hackers-took-trillions-in-intellectual-property-from-about-30-multinational-companies/\">stole Western technology and trade secrets on a massive scale</a>, in an effort to build a domestic economy on par with Europe and the United States. During the last decade, under President Xi Jinping, China has also become militarily aggressive, claiming disputed territories in surrounding seas, rapidly building up its military and repeatedly threatening the breakaway republic of Taiwan.</p> \n<p>Posen cites research showing that \"Buy-America\" policies tend to raise costs—since American goods are typically more expensive—without any corresponding gain in efficiency. That lowers productivity. Raising the cost of domestic production also makes US exports more expensive in foreign markets, which cuts exports.</p> \n<p>Another problem with industrial policy is the tinkering often required to get the desired result, and the complexities and unintended consequences that often crop up. This is already happening with the domestic-content requirements for the electric-vehicle tax credits Biden signed into law last year. The Biden administration has made those requirements looser than some legislators intended, to address objections by some foreign automakers and to account for certain materials not (yet) produced in the United States. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a key force getting that bill passed last year, now says the method of implementation may “<a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-inflation-reduction-act-betrayal-joe-manchin-debt-ceiling-budget-fossil-fuels-green-energy-dc37738e\">violate and subvert the law</a>.” Manchin has even <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democratic-sen-manchin-threatens-legal-action-over-treasury-ev-battery-guidance-2023-03-29/\">threatened to sue</a> stop the credits from going into effect, unless there are changes.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Biden may feel he has no choice but to roll out muscular industrial policy, because China does it very effectively. The Chinese government has broad control over key economic sectors and uses that control to advance national priorities determined by the Chinese Communist Party, such as domestic development of artificial intelligence, electric vehicle technology, and pharmaceutical components. The traditional U.S. approach was to create incentives here and there, but broadly let the market determine where jobs and production should go. As China grew dominant in steel production, shipbuilding and other industries, however, some free marketeers have become more comfortable with the idea of a heavier government hand in parts of the U.S. economy.</p> \n<p>There will be flubs, as there usually are when the government tries to steer the development of one technology or another. China itself has a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-07/china-s-great-property-bubble-deflation-experiment?sref=eeq6exxF\">vastly overbuilt and over-subsidized real-estate sector</a>, and the government has to prop up many <a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/2014/11/21/rethinking-china-s-state-owned-enterprises-pub-57298\">state-owned firms that lose money</a>. In the United States, the poster-child for wasted government subsidies is <a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/04/12/remembering-solyndra--how-many-570m-green-energy-failures-are-hidden-inside-bidens-instructure-proposal/\">Solyndra</a>, the California solar company that got <a data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/specialreports/solyndra-scandal/\">$570 million in taxpayer funding during the Obama administration</a> and then went bust. There will probably be more Solyndras in America’s future. Yet it's hard to see a future president, of either party, backing away from policies meant to give the U.S. economy an edge over China’s—even if it doesn’t always work out that way.</p> \n<p><strong><em>Rick Newman is a senior columnist for </em></strong><a data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/rick-newman/?.tsrc=fin-srch\"><strong><em>Yahoo Finance</em></strong></a><strong><em>.

        "content": "<p>By Chuck Mikolajczak </p> \n<p> NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar climbed in an abbreviated session on Friday after employment data for March indicated the labor market remained tight last month, raising the odds that the Federal Reserve has at least one more rate hike in store. </p> \n<p> Wall Street exchanges were closed until Monday due to the Good Friday holiday. European markets are closed on both Friday and Monday. </p> \n<p> Nonfarm payrolls increased by 236,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said, very close to the 239,000 expectated by economists surveyed by Reuters. </p> \n<p> Data for February was revised higher to show 326,000 jobs were added instead of 311,000 as previously reported. The unemployment rate dipped to 3.5% from 3.6% in the prior month. </p> \n<p> “The unemployment rate fell. I believe it's the lowest since mid-2021. Year-over-year earnings slowed, but that's kind of good news for the Fed,\" said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics in San Franciso. </p> \n<p> \"Nevertheless, the data are going to keep the Fed on track for a 25-basis-point hike in May,\" Rupert said. </p> \n<p> The CME's emini S&amp;P 500 futures contract EScv1 reversed a slight loss, closing up 0.23% shortly after the jobs report. The dollar strengthened and U.S. Treasury yields rose as expectations the Federal Reserve will hike rates at its May meeting increased. </p> \n<p> Money market traders priced in a 67% chance for a 25 basis point rate hike, up from 49.2% on Thursday, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. </p> \n<p> MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.044%. </p> \n<p> In Asia, Japan's Nikkei share average rose on Friday, trimming its weekly decline, as a weaker yen and higher Wall Street close overnight boosted sentiment ahead of the payrolls report. </p> \n<p> \"While the headline number of payrolls is still elevated, hours are being cut with the index of aggregate weekly hours falling two months in a row,\" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. </p> \n<p> \"The employment situation has gone from red hot to merely smoldering.\" </p> \n<p> Benchmark 10-year note yields were up 12.3 basis points to 3.413%, from 3.29% late on Thursday. </p> \n<p> The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 17.2 basis points at 3.993%. </p> \n<p> The dollar index rose 0.137%, with the euro down 0.09% to $1.091. </p> \n<p> (Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Jan Harvey) </p>",

        "content": "<p>The Federal Reserve and everybody else following the economy have been desperately looking for signs the economy is cooling. Finally, it is.</p> \n<p>Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, which is a solid monthly improvement—but it’s also the smallest gain in 27 months. There’s now a solid trend in place showing moderation in the job market after two years of COVID-related distortions and a seemingly unquenchable need for workers.</p> \n<p>Earnings are up 4.2% from a year ago, which is also decent—yet that trend is declining, too. A year ago, earnings were growing at a 5.9% annual rate, which raised concerns about a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wage-price-spiral.asp\">wage-price spiral</a> in which higher labor costs push prices up and lock in inflation. But that doesn’t seem to be happening, either.</p> \n<p>This is exactly what the Fed wants to see, and President Biden probably likes it, too. The Fed has been aggressively hiking interest rates to bring inflation down, and one sign that is working is cooling demand for labor. That’s what we’re seeing. Inflation peaked at 9% last June, and it’s now down to 6%. The Fed wants inflation below 3%, and decelerating job growth suggests that’s where it is heading.</p> \n<div id=\"79703ab0c1dc4ec59613c06e66610f80\"></div> \n<p>There are other signs of a slowdown that should further reassure the Fed. A separate report showed that job openings dropped to 9.9 million in February, which, again, is elevated, but 17% below the peak from last spring. A historically low level of applications for unemployment insurance has been ticking upward since January. A service-sector report shows a slowdown there, too. That’s important because goods inflation is back to normal, but services inflation is still too high. A slowdown in service activity should bring that inflation down.</p> \n<p>Two important trends are emerging. First, the Fed is either done hiking interest rates or nearly done. It has raised short-term rates by 4.75 percentage points since last March, including a quarter-point hike on March 22 that some policymakers thought was excessive. If the consumer-price report on April 12 shows a further dip in the inflation rate, as expected, the Fed may have all the top cover it needs to shift into neutral. Even if it doesn’t, future rate hikes will be minimal.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/331d38a0-c8f1-11ed-b7f9-4af2c64d0cd8\" style=\"height:5760px;width:8640px;\" alt=\"Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference at the Federal Reserve, Wednesday, March 22, 2023, in Washington.

The COVID public health emergency will officially end on May 11, and we can think of the economy as checking out of rehab, as well.</p> \n<p>The next question is whether the Fed went too far, or just far enough. Tremors from the surprise bank failures of early March have not yet spread throughout the economy, but they will. Bank lending has dropped since those failures revealed cracks in the financial system, and that will lead to slower growth in a few months’ time. If the bank failures are over, it might all work out. But if there are more bank problems, it could cause a credit seizure and a recession.</p> \n<p>The debate among economists as to whether a recession is imminent will continue, maybe forever. “Whether or not the Fed squeezes in a final rate hike, we still think they will be cutting again later this year as the economy falls into recession,” Capital Economics advised on April 7.</p> \n<p>“Recession? What recession?” University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/1644323597534523394?s=20\">tweeted after the jobs report came out.</a> “Those looking for a recession can't find it in these data.”</p> \n<p>Biden obviously doesn’t want a recession, but if there is one, timing matters a lot. If a recession is coming, Biden would want it over and done with in 2023, so that a recovery will be underway when he is presumably running for reelection next year.</p> \n<p>When will we know? Give it three more months of data. If a credit freeze is going to ice the economy, we should see the evidence by summer. And if the Fed went too far, it’ll show up in a labor market that isn’t just slowing, but shrinking, with unemployment going up. That's not inevitable, though, and it's possible the economy just entered a comfort zone it will stay in for a while.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong><em>Rick Newman is a senior columnist for </em></strong><a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/rick-newman/?.tsrc=fin-srch\"><strong><em>Yahoo Finance</em></strong></a><strong><em>.

Sales of plug-in electric vehicles kept rising explosively and reached a record 32pc of the market for standard passenger cars.</p>\n<p>At the current pace, EV sales in China will hit eight million this year, helped by the proliferation of battery-swapping stations. Rather than charging your own car, you do an instant swap. No need to wait. No need for charge-points everywhere.</p>\n<p>Sales have surged despite the elimination of subsidies at the end of last year. &nbsp;China’s best-selling EV is the BYD Song Plus, which retails for about £22,000. Number two is the smaller Wuling Mini. It starts at around £4,000 (not a misprint).</p>\n<p>“They are producing cheap EVs for the mass market, which is still completely lacking in the West. It is absolutely taking off,” said Lord Adair Turner, chairman of the global Energy Transitions Commission (ETC).</p>\n<p>The consensus forecast until recently was that <a href=\"https://www.energy-transitions.org/\">EV penetration would reach 40pc of Chinese sales by 2030</a>. That threshold could be crossed as soon as this year if manufacturers can produce fast enough to meet the demand. “We think EVs will reach 80pc of sales in China by 2030,” said Kingsmill Bond from energy strategists RMI.</p>\n<p>Electrification is spreading to light commercial vehicles, up 85pc year-on-year. &nbsp;Over <a href=\"https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/china-hvs-ze-bus-truck-market-2021-jan23.pdf\">60pc of buses in service in Chinese cities are already low-carbon</a>. All municipal buses on the eastern seaboard will be electrified by 2025. Long-haul trucks are next in line.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that EVs worldwide have already displaced 1.5m barrels a day (b/d) of oil use, or 1.5pc of global demand. This is about to accelerate exponentially.</p>\n<p>“China’s demand for oil is suddenly going to start falling. Half of China's total car fleet could be electric by 2030. If you add up the numbers, that could subtract several million barrels of oil a day,” said Lord Turner. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“China’s high speed rail network means that there won’t be so much internal aviation either. Oil use per capita is never going to be anything close to American levels,” he said.</p>\n<p>Opec maintains the fiction that oil demand will keep booming until the middle of the century, but this is based on the obsolete premise that Asia's rising middle class will more than compensate for declining imports in Europe and America.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Whatever they say in public, the Saudis know the game is up. They can see that the world’s largest car market for petrol cars is going to collapse,” said RMI’s Mr Bond. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the last 40 years the Saudis have acted (mostly) as ‘Federal Reserve’ of the global oil market, working closely with the US and Europe to maintain stability. They would restrain Opec hotheads from pushing prices too high at critical moments, knowing that this would backfire by accelerating the switch to rival technologies.</p>\n<p>It has <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/10/13/markets-latest-economy-sterling-pound-bailey-bank-england-ftse/\">abandoned this role as market regulator under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman</a>. The strategy today is to extract as much money as possible from crude reserves before the window shuts forever, deliberately forcing prices higher (by cartel practices) to exploit captive demand for legacy transport.</p>\n<p>Last weekend’s Saudi-led decision by Opec and Russia to cut global supply by a further 1.1m b/d is an act of weakness. It is not the action of states seeking to preserve a sustainable business model.</p>\n<p>It was an affront to President Joe Biden but it was no favour for Xi Jinping either. Oil shocks are horrible for China. Its energy intensity per unit of GDP is two and a half times higher than in the US.</p>\n<p>America is largely self-sufficient in crude: China is the world’s largest importer by far at 10.8m b/d. Its oil-import dependency has risen to 70pc, a greater level of vulnerability than the US at the worst point of the Arab oil embargo in 1973.</p>\n<p>This oil is mostly shipped in tankers through the Straits of Molucca. China is also the world’s biggest importer of liquefied natural gas, which also comes on ships. This is a glaring geostrategic weakness as the superpower clash with the US turns increasingly dangerous.</p>\n<p>Chinese strategists can see how the West is using its stranglehold over global tanker fleets, vessel insurance, and shipping finance to asphyxiate Russia. They have also studied Franklin Roosevelt’s blockade of Japanese oil imports in 1941. They know that China cannot risk a showdown over Taiwan until it has a safer supply of energy. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hence the massive expansion of renewable power currently underway. Great tracts of desert in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Xinjiang are being covered with solar panels and onshore turbines, bundled with extra coal capacity as a back-up to avoid winter blackouts.</p>\n<p>Xi Jinping’s original plan was to reach 1,200 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar by 2030. China’s Research Academy of Environmental Sciences says this target will be achieved five years early, given that the rollout is running at 180 GW a year.</p>\n<p>This compares to total installed capacity of 33 GW in France, 42 GW in the UK, and 240 GW in the US since the start of the green era.</p>\n<p>Nikhil Bhandari and Amber Cai from Goldman Sachs think China will <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/china-may-reach-energy-self-sufficiency-by-2060.html\">smash the target three times over</a>, reaching a staggering 3,300 GW by the end of this decade, all backed by a vast expansion of energy storage. They estimate that the county could halve its total energy imports by the early 2040s.</p>\n<p>This would require $2.2 trillion of investments but that should not be understood as a cost. Goldman says combined renewables with storage operating around the clock will be highly profitable by 2030 as they undercut coal, with a rate of return on capital reaching 10pc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They think China’s total CO2 emissions will peak as soon as 2028.</p>\n<p>China is not doing this as a favour to the West. It is doing so in order to confront the West from a position of greater strength in the future, and because it aims to become the world’s clean-tech hegemon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Chinese have already cornered 90pc of global production of solar panels, and control 70pc of the lithium output – although that may matter less as sodium-ion batteries arrive.</p>\n<p>One can be too cynical about China’s motives. Xi Jinping was an environmental crusader 20 years ago as Zhejiang party chief. &nbsp;He was a pioneer of the radical ‘Green GDP’ campaign in 2004, which called on local governments to subtract ecological damage from the raw GDP figures. He knows that China is more immediately vulnerable to climate change than the US or Europe.</p>\n<p>Chinese scientists say the Himalayan glaciers – the Third Pole – are melting even faster than previously thought. They will shrink by two-thirds over the course of this century under current warming trends, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/01/26/china-focus-economic-growth-rather-environment/\">exposing China’s ancient river systems to the annual devastation of spring floods followed by summer droughts</a>. So yes, China has to act.</p>\n<p>China’s green leap forward is a nightmare for Big Oil. It is compelling America and Europe to respond in kind, causing a step-change in the arms race for clean-tech ascendancy.</p>\n<p>The EU’s retreat from its 2035 ban on combustion engines makes no difference in this larger geo-economic context. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/03/30/efuels-help-britain-avoid-scrapping-its-auto-industry/\">The permitted e-fuels, made from green hydrogen</a>, are too wasteful and expensive to have any commercial relevance. They retain just 16pc of the original energy input compared to 77pc for EVs.</p>\n<p>The next generation of solid state batteries and lithium-air variants will complete the annihilation in the late 2020s, opening the way to EVs with much longer driving ranges, much lower costs, and less reliance on scarce minerals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Technology married to market forces will render fossil-fuel bans in the EU, the UK, Japan, California, or Quebec superfluous before they come into force.</p>\n<p>Personally, I had assumed that oil would enjoy one last hurrah in the early 2020s as a decade of under-investment drives prices to $150 or $200. But this does not seem so inevitable any more. The rallies keep fading.</p>\n<p>The events of the last week suggest that the process of oil displacement is more advanced than we had assumed. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the petrostates have already entered the first stage of terminal run-off.</p>",

Due to their relatively short term, one-year CDs are an attractive option for savers who prefer access to their money soon to make a planned purchase or a new investment.</p> \n<p>A CD typically earns a fixed annual percentage yield (APY), so you’ll be able to determine exactly how much money will be in the account when the term ends. Here we’ll provide examples in which $2,500 is invested in a <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/cds/best-1-year-cd-rates/\">one-year CD</a> in accounts that pay the national average rate as well those that earn a highly competitive rate and show you how much money you’d have when the CDs mature in 12 months.</p> \n<h2><span id=\"national-avg\"></span>National average 1-year CD rates</h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/cds/current-cd-interest-rates/\">national average one-year CD rate</a> is currently an annual percentage yield (APY) of 1.68 percent. This rate has mostly increased or stayed the same since March 2022.</p> \n<p>If you were to open a one-year CD today that earns the national average rate of 1.68 percent, the account balance would be around $2,542 when the CD matures in 12 months’ time. This is shown in the following breakdown:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Type of account</strong>: 1-year CD</li> \n <li><strong>Opening deposit</strong>: $2,500</li> \n <li><strong>APY</strong>: 1.68%</li> \n <li><strong>Total interest after 1 year</strong>: around $42</li> \n <li><strong>Total value of CD after 1 year</strong>: around $2,542</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Bankrate’s <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/cds/cd-calculator/\">CD calculator</a> is a quick and easy way to determine how much total interest a CD will earn when you plug in the term, deposit amount and APY.</p> \n<h2><span id=\"competitive\"></span>Competitive 1-year CD rates</h2> \n<p>Savers who shop around can find one-year CD rates that are significantly higher than the national average. For instance, dozens of banks and credit unions currently offer one-year CDs that pay an APY of 4 percent or higher. The highest APYs available right now are above 5 percent.</p> \n<p>An APY of 5 percent, for instance, is more than three times higher than the current national average rate of 1.68 percent for one-year CDs. If you were to open a one-year CD today that earns 5 percent, the ending balance in 12 months-time would be around $2,625. This is shown in the following breakdown:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Type of account</strong>: 1-year CD</li> \n <li><strong>Opening deposit</strong>: $2,500</li> \n <li><strong>APY</strong>: 5.00%</li> \n <li><strong>Total interest after 1 year</strong>: around $125</li> \n <li><strong>Total value of CD after 1 year</strong>: around $2,625</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Going with a one-year CD with the much more competitive rate of 5 percent would earn you around $83 more in total interest than going with the CD that earns the national average rate.</p> \n<p>The highest CD and savings account rates tend to be offered by <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/best-online-banks/\">online banks</a>, which don’t have the overhead costs of maintaining branches.</p> \n<h2><span id=\"factors-returns\"></span>Factors that can affect CD returns</h2> \n<p><strong>Amount of deposit</strong>: No matter what rate a CD pays, the more money you deposit, the more interest you’ll ultimately earn. Some banks require minimum deposit amounts for CDs, which may range from $50 to $2,500 or more.</p> \n<p><strong>APY</strong>: Often referred to simply as the yield or the rate, the <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/what-is-apy/\">APY</a> indicates how much a bank account earns in one year. The higher the APY, the more interest you’ll earn.</p> \n<p><strong>Length of CD term</strong>: CD APYs tend to vary based on the length of the term, which usually ranges from three months to five years. The longer the term, the more time your money has to earn interest. While longer terms sometimes mean higher rates, this isn’t always the case. For instance, while the national average for a one-year CD is currently 1.68 percent, the national average for a five-year CD is only 1.24 percent.</p> \n<h2><span id=\"cd-vs-savings\"></span>1-year CD vs. savings account</h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/best-high-yield-interests-savings-accounts/\">best high-yield savings accounts</a> currently pay APYs of just above 5 percent. When choosing between a one-year CD and a savings account, there are factors to consider:</p> \n<p><strong>Liquidity</strong>: If you might need the funds for emergencies or other expenses before the 12 months are up, a savings account is a better choice. This is because you can withdraw money from a savings account at any time, while taking money out of a CD before the term ends usually results in an <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/cds/how-to-avoid-cd-early-withdrawal-penalty/\">early withdrawal penalty</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Fixed or variable rate of return</strong>: While a savings account rate can fluctuate at any time, CD rates are generally locked in from the start. If you believe rates will decrease in the coming months, you may decide a CD is a better choice. Conversely, sticking with a savings account may be a wiser move in a rising rate environment.</p> \n<h2>Bottom line</h2> \n<p>One-year CD rates can vary significantly from bank to bank, with <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/best-big-banks/\">big banks</a> often paying lackluster yields and online-only banks typically paying much higher APYs. It pays to shop around for the best rate and use a CD calculator to determine how much will be in your account when the CD matures in 12 months.</p>",

Or whether your income in your post-work years will be enough to keep you afloat? It's normal to be curious about the average retirement income in the U.S. Just remember that you need enough in your retiree days&nbsp;to meet your&nbsp;own needs, not to keep up with the Joneses. A <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm[…]m_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=averageretirementincome\">financial advisor</a> can help you create a financial plan to reach your retirement goals.<span></span></p> \n<strong>Average Social Security Retirement Income</strong> \n<p>We all know that saving for retirement is the wise course of action. That's why we have&nbsp;Social Security, a form of forced savings that diverts income from our working years to our golden years. Social Security benefits were never designed to be Americans' sole source of retirement income, though. That's why saving for retirement, either through an employer-sponsored plan or on your own, is so important.</p> \n<p>According to the Social Security Administration, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/social-security-calculator\">Social Security benefits</a> make up about a third of the income of the elderly. In general, single people depend more heavily on Social Security checks than do married people. In 2023, the average monthly retirement income from <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/colafacts2023.pdf\">Social Security is $1,827</a>.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind, though, that your Social Security benefits could be smaller. If you don't have 35 years of work under your belt when you start claiming benefits, if your earnings were consistently low or if you claim benefits starting at age 62 rather than waiting until your <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/full-retirement-age\">full retirement age</a> (or age 70, if you want maximum benefits), then you can expect a small monthly check. There's also a gender gap in Social Security income. Women, because they tend to earn less and work for fewer years, draw smaller Social Security checks than men do.</p> \n<p>The more money you make during your career, the greater the gap between your income needs and your Social Security benefits. Say you're a family of four with two high earners, a big fancy home and a high-roller lifestyle. You'll have a much harder time getting by on Social Security than would someone who can handle a lower-middle class income. That means you'll need to allocate a healthy sum to retirement savings during your working years, or risk a downturn in your quality of life in retirement.</p> \n<p>If you're married, remember that your retirement-related decisions affect your spouse, too. The amount a surviving spouse can get from Social Security depends on the other spouse's work history – and on when that spouse claims Social Security. In other words, the spouses of folks who start claiming Social Security at age 62 will receive less money in survivor benefits.</p> \n<strong>Average Retirement Income From Savings</strong> \n<p><img alt=\"SmartAsset: What Is the Average Retirement Income?\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ToEeNl5YjEoqLoxMzuCS8g--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/smartasset_475/7988749da135af0a18aeb28793ba3356\" width=\"590\" data-uuid=\"833b3f80-1777-3d60-9031-55bed1de8f4f\"></p> \n<p>You may have heard about an impending retirement income shortfall&nbsp;in the U.S. Words like \"crisis\" and \"disaster\" appear in plenty of articles that lament Americans' lack of retirement savings.</p> \n<p>According to the National&nbsp;Institute on Retirement Security, almost 40 million households have no retirement savings at all. The Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) estimates in its 2019 Retirement Security Projection Model that America's current retirement savings deficit is $3.8 trillion. What does that mean? Well, the EBRI report aggregates the savings deficit of all U.S. households headed by someone between the ages of 35 and 64, inclusive. In total, those households have $3.8 trillion fewer dollars in savings than they should have for retirement.</p> \n<p>For more recent data, Fidelity Investments <a href=\"https://fidelityinvestments2020news.q4web.com/press-releases/news-details/2022/Fidelity-Q3-2022-Retirement-Analysis-Despite-Continued-Volatility-Retirement-Fundamentals-Remain-Sound/default.aspx\">reported that in the third quarter of 2022</a> the average account balance for an IRA was $101,900. Employees with a 401(k) averaged $97,200, while those with a 403(b) had $87,400.</p> \n<p>Fidelity also estimated that \"an average retired <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/personal-finance/plan-for-rising-health-care-costs\">couple age 65 in 2022 may need approximately $315,000</a> saved (after tax) to cover health care expenses in retirement.\"&nbsp; Keeping in mind that more Americans are also living longer than ever before, they will face more challenges to cover medical expenses in retirement.</p> \n<strong>Drawing&nbsp;Down Retirement Income</strong> \n<p>According to Gallup, the average retirement age is now 62.&nbsp;Let's say you've done a stellar job of saving for retirement. You've decided to hang up your hat and begin the post-work phase of life. How do you know how much you can safely withdraw from your retirement accounts to live on?</p> \n<p>Unless you buy an annuity, you'll have to make that decision based on your spending needs and on the performance of your investments. That's why the typical recommendation – that a retiree&nbsp;follow a&nbsp;4% annual withdrawal rate – isn't fool-proof.&nbsp;Our retirement calculator assumes that you'll draw down your retirement income in a strategic fashion, letting tax-deferred accounts grow for as long as you can and spending from accounts with Required Minimum Distributions before you touch Roth accounts, to meet a specific lifestyle (either extravagant, similar to today, modest or budget-conscious). No 4% rule here.</p> \n<strong>Bottom Line</strong> \n<p><img alt=\"SmartAsset: What Is the Average Retirement Income?\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/J_Zxn5t1a1gJc6isU9sY0w--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/smartasset_475/dcccebd5980db0ca6cb4c9c95b892185\" width=\"590\" data-uuid=\"08b41228-862c-333f-965d-e223e00dcf6e\"></p> \n<p>Social Security benefits are great, but they're not much on their own.

        "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>I recently reported on a stalled attempt to build a utopia for entrepreneurs and celebrities on Utah’s Powder Mountain, a ski hill an hour from Salt Lake City. The <a href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/summit-powder-mountain-utopia/\">story</a>—which appears in this month’s print issue of <em>Fortune</em>—had the ingredients of a dramatic business tale: billionaires and star investors, stunning real estate, local backlash, lawyers trading accusations about elitism and money laundering, and an apparent battle of egos between founders.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>And nestled in this yarn was an age-old management lesson: Every company needs a board.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2>What happened?</h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Summit Village was to be an eco-friendly “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjAlMo4G35w\">intentional community</a>” for tech-centric, socially conscious entrepreneurs, with hotels, condos, restaurants, a science center, greenhouses, curated retailers, and more. There were also to be 500 elegant, ski-accessible homes built into the mountainside.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Today, however, the project is stalled, and changing business strategies. Over 90% of the promised houses have yet to be built, and the village exists only as a concept. There are no hotels, full-service restaurants, or shops on the mountain, let alone the slew of promised amenities. The reasons for the delays are myriad, including lawsuits over funding and complaints from the local Mormon community, but several sources said the fundamental problem was organizational dysfunction and friction between the owners who had paired up on the mega project—none of them with a lick of experience as real estate developers or ski resort operators.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>And as I wrote in the piece, the project went several years after the 2013 purchase without a board, which Elliott Bisnow, a Summit Series founder, regretted:</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><a href=\"https://emma.msrb.org/IssueView/Details/EA348217#tabContinuingDisclosure\"><em>Public filings</em></a><em> required under the terms of the bond agreement with the county show that the Summit team faced a $2.2 million cash-flow shortfall by 2017 and was hemorrhaging money, paying out an estimated $14 million in payroll in 2016 and 2017 combined. The group decided to add a professional board.</em></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><em>When I asked Bisnow what he would have done differently on Powder Mountain, he admitted: “I wish we’d put a board together even sooner.”</em></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2>Why don’t more startups embrace boards early?</h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>I <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/11/18/ftx-board-investor-chamath-palihapitiya-sam-bankman-fried-board-directors-crypto/\">looked at this issue</a> when Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange collapsed in November. It had emerged that a prominent potential investor had suggested FTX add a board but the company reportedly replied with an unambiguous message: “Go ‘f-ck yourself.”</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>At the time, Peter Gleason, head of the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD), told me that CEOs who can’t see the benefit of having a real board with independent directors puzzled him: “How many jobs in your career do you have 10 or 12 advisors to help you succeed?” he asked.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Outsider board members can provide regulatory and financial oversight, bring fresh perspectives, improve decision-making, and, crucially, offer a clear-eyed view of business risks. Independent directors can also play referee, soothing relationships when market conditions drive stress and disagreements.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>The governance experts at PwC’s Governance Insights Center have looked at the reasons many <a href=\"https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/05/23/private-company-boards-need-outside-directors/\">private firms resist adding outside board members</a> and concluded that many leaders fear the way it may slow down decision-making and create expectations of more formalities and bureaucracy. CEOs and founders may see meeting-planning and recording as unnecessary hassles. “These activities take time,” the consultants at PwC concede. Even so, “[t]his investment typically pays off, and in some situations can come in handy.”</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>At Powder, the current board has “a much more elevated set of skills than the Summit founders, whether it’s around finance or real estate development,” Bisnow told me.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Roni Yehuda, a diamond industry executive and Powder Mountain homeowner who last year became chair of the board, said he believes in a culture of transparency and diplomacy—a promising sign for the group’s future.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Lila MacLellan<br>lila.maclellan@fortune.com<br>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilaMacLellan?s=20&amp;t=xlXKNLHl8rLY-AnX7hNNBQ\"><strong>lilamaclellan</strong></a><br><br></p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/04/07/the-story-of-a-stalled-ski-resort-utopia-proves-startups-need-professional-boards/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>\n<strong>More from Fortune:&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>\n<ul>\n <br> \n <li><a href=\"https://fortune.com/recommends/banking/lucrative-side-hustles-you-can-do-from-home/?utm_source=Yahoo%21%20Finance&amp;utm_medium=promo-module-bottom&amp;utm_campaign=syndicationpromo&amp;utm_term=The%20tale%20of%20a%20stalled%20ski%20resort%20explodes%20the%20myth%20that%20founders%20don%27t%20need%20outsiders%20on%20their%20boards\">5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home</a></li>\n <br> \n <li><a href=\"https://fortune.com/recommends/banking/what-happens-when-a-bank-fails/?utm_source=Yahoo%21%20Finance&amp;utm_medium=promo-module-bottom&amp;utm_campaign=syndicationpromo&amp;utm_term=The%20tale%20of%20a%20stalled%20ski%20resort%20explodes%20the%20myth%20that%20founders%20don%27t%20need%20outsiders%20on%20their%20boards\">Expert advice to keep your money safe during bank failures</a></li>\n <br> \n <li><a href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/summit-powder-mountain-utopia/?utm_source=Yahoo%21%20Finance&amp;utm_medium=promo-module-bottom&amp;utm_campaign=syndicationpromo&amp;utm_term=The%20tale%20of%20a%20stalled%20ski%20resort%20explodes%20the%20myth%20that%20founders%20don%27t%20need%20outsiders%20on%20their%20boards\">The young creators of a \"TED meets Burning Man\" conference bought a $40-million mountain.

Such a diverse economic sector will bring along unparalleled arrays of investment opportunities. </p> \n<p>In a recent note on the refining sector, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta outlined the factors that investor should look at in <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/energy-sector\">energy stocks</a>: “We believe this environment allows for companies with accelerating capital returns and strong operations to outperform, as well as those with steadier earnings contribution from non-refining segments and attractive capital returns profiles to outperform.”</p> \n<p>Against the backdrop, Goldman Sachs analysts have pointed out potential two energy winners for the months ahead. Both are Buy-rated names with double-digit upside potential, and offer a small dividend as a bonus. Let’s take a closer look.</p> \n<p><strong>Phillips 66 (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/psx/forecast\">PSX</a>)</strong></p> \n<p>First up is Houston-based Phillips 66, an oil major that saw total revenues exceed $111 billion in 2021 and jump to $170 billion in 2022. The company has a presence in most aspects of the oil and gas industries. Phillips brings crude oil and gas products to the refineries, and markets a wide range of fuel products, as well as lubricating oils, industrial chemicals, and petrochemicals.</p> \n<p>Phillips currently operates 13 refineries, which together produce a wide range of fuels and fuel oils that the company markets under multiple brand names. The Phillips 66 shield – the ubiquitous gas station sign modeled on interstate highway numbers – is recognized across the country, as are names like Conoco and 76. In addition, Phillips produces fuels for the aviation industry, and its chemical products can be found in industry, agribusiness, and the medical and pharmaceutical sectors.</p> \n<p>Turning to Phillips’ financial results, the company saw non-GAAP EPS of $4 in 4Q22, up 35% year-over-year. While impressive, that figure came in below the consensus estimate of $4.35. The company has plenty of cash resources, and finished 2022 with $12.8 billion in liquid assets, including $6.1 billion in cash. This total included the $4.8 billion in operating cash flow generated in Q4. </p> \n<p>Management authorized a $5 billion increase to the firm’s share repurchase program, and in the most recent declaration the company raised its dividend payment by 8 cents, or 8.2%, to $1.05 per common share. The annualized dividend now yields 4%.</p> \n<p>Among the bulls is Goldman’s Neil Mehta, who writes of Phillips: “Our top pick in the group remains Phillips 66, which is on the Americas Conviction List. On our 2024 estimates, PSX trades at only 8.3X P/E compared to the sector average of 10.6X P/E, representing an attractive entry point…”</p> \n<p>“We see room for investors to get more positive on the outlook for medium and longer term business transformation, with potential upside in earnings forecasts to the extent the company delivers on its cost reduction targets and any potential uplift from the recently announced DCP transaction,” the analyst added.</p> \n<p>To this end, Mehta rates PSX shares a Buy along with a $125 price target. The figure implies shares will be valued 22% higher in a year’s time. (To watch Mehta’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/neil-mehta\">click here</a>)</p> \n<p>Overall, PSX shares have a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 10 recent analyst reviews with a breakdown of 6 Buys to 4 Holds. The stock’s average price target stands at $128.80 and implies a 25% upside from the current share price of $102.84.

Shell is also one of the oil sector’s most diversified companies, with its operations divided into four segments: Upstream, Integrated Gas, Renewables &amp; Energy Solutions, and Downstream. Operations in these segments include everything from exploration and extraction activities, to natural gas liquefaction and delivery, to renewable hydrogen and low-carbon power production, to fuel and energy delivery to more than 32 million customers.</p> \n<p>Outside of these activities, Shell also has a Projects &amp; Technology division that drives the company’s research and innovation projects into new solutions for energy tech. In addition, Projects &amp; Tech also provides needed technical capabilities and services in the operational divisions.</p> \n<p>These combined operations brought Shell a total of $101.3 billion in top-line revenues for 4Q22, the most recent period reported, up 18% year-over-year – and beating the forecast by an impressive $59.97 billion.</p> \n<p>At the bottom line, Shell had $9.8 billion in adjusted earnings for 4Q22, up 3.1% y/y. Drilling down, this income gave an adjusted EPS of $1.39. The bottom-line EPS compares favorably to the $0.83 from 4Q21 – but even so, the 4Q22 EPS was 92 cents below expectations.</p> \n<p>Even with the mixed quarterly results, Shell saw fit to raise its dividend in Q4, bumping it up from 25 cents per common share to 28.75 cents, an increase of 15%. The new payment annualizes to $1.15 and yields 2%.</p> \n<p>Covering this stock for Goldman, analyst Michele Della Vigna writes: “We believe the company has the highest quality combination of assets in the sector, with a leading global LNG and marketing businesses and strong chemical presence. We see material upside to operational performance in both deepwater and LNG assets, while the company’s strong balance sheet might allow it to veer towards the upper end of the sector’s new 30-40% cash distribution range…”</p> \n<p>Della Vigna goes on to rate SHEL as a Buy, and he sets a price target of $85 to suggest a 40% potential upside on the one-year time frame. (To watch Della Vigna’s track record, <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/michele-della-vigna\">click here</a>)</p> \n<p>Overall, we’re looking at a stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street. The rating is based on 7 recent analyst reviews, including 4 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares have an average price target of $69.01, implying ~14% upside from the current trading price of $60.57.

Then it's off to scuba dive for the rest of the week.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is reportedly the reality for a cluster of sought-after tech specialists getting \"penned\" by major industries like banking, telecommunications and travel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The term refers to a hiring trend where rare candidates are taken on by businesses despite having no work to do, but are on call in case they're needed.</p> \n<p>Dr. Emmanuel Maggiori, who has worked with top global companies as an A.I. specialist and data scientist and is currently freelancing at a multinational investment bank, told <em>Fortune</em> he left academia because he wanted to make an impact in the commercial sector only to find himself twiddling his thumbs.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Dr. Maggiori clearly remembers the moment he realized doing little-to-no work was the norm in some teams.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"I spent a couple of months on a project and my bosses were really pleased with it,\" he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"One of them said to me: 'You made this happen. If you didn't do any work for a year now, we'd be happy we hired you.' I didn't want to be rewarded with not working.\"</p> \n<p>In the coming years working as a freelance software engineer, Dr. Maggiori worked with an array of big businesses and continued to find career stagnancy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Team meetings, he said, were filled with people pitching the tasks they were working on.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Colleagues would block out entire weeks to complete what he claimed were 10-minute jobs in a behavior known as \"task bloating\".&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"In a previous role, I heard one person used to scuba diving during office hours. Another person I know just watches online courses all day—they might leave when their employer stops paying for a subscription,\" he added.</p> \n<p>Data supports these anecdotes in some cases: Google Cloud’s DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/dora-2022-accelerate-state-of-devops-report-now-out\">'State of DevOps' report for 2022</a> found that the number of 'low' performers in the software supply sector had more than doubled when compared to the previous year, from 7% to 19%.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Low performers are classed as respondents who deploy services less frequently, have longer turnarounds for changes and service restorations, or who have worked on updates that degrade the service and will require fixing.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Trying to stay busy</h2> \n<p>Determined to be proactive, Dr. Maggiori said he continually asked for work and was given tasks like \"chasing\" people for updates—who never replied—before being told by a superior: \"I don't want to tell you to stop asking questions, but maybe don't.\"</p> \n<p>It was in banking that Dr. Maggiori witnessed the full extent of candidate \"penning\" for the first time.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Under a new contract paying $978 a day, he waited two months before his requests for something to do were answered.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"During those two months all I had to do was attend the weekly meeting for admin, which was stuff like: 'Make sure you book a desk if you're coming into the office,' he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Peers in Big Tech have similar stories, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/03/16/meta-hoarded-us-like-pokemon-cards-former-staffer-fight-for-work-mark-zuckerberg/\">with one former Meta staffer saying the company hoarded candidates \"like Pokemon cards\"</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Brit Levy said on TikTok she had to \"fight for work\", adding her teammates spent hours \"dog fooding\" –exploring the Metaverse for bugs—in order to look busy.</p> \n<p>In an anonymous survey posted to the online career community <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.teamblind.com/post/How-many-real-hours-of-work-do-you-put-in-each-day-CV1K6aXM\"><em>Blind</em></a>, one user asked: \"How many focused hours of work do you put in each day as a software engineer?\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The vast majority, 71.3% of the 4,246 respondents, claimed they worked six hours or less a day.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The largest proportion of voters—32.4%—said they work between three and four hours, followed by 26.7% who said they worked between five and six hours a day.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>12.2% said they did between one and two hours a day.</p> \n<p>A source—working for one of America's top ten banks—told <em>Fortune</em> the majority of software developers they work with are forced to do nothing when they are first hired due to complex onboarding.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Speaking under the conditions of anonymity, they explained: \"Software work is incredibly complex with a lot of rules and the financial sector is even worse because of all the regulations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"A lot of it is down to processes—we often have difficulty getting them access to the right level for them to be able to work. That can take weeks, you can have somebody start and they don't even have access to the system.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"They literally just have to sit there –there are lots of software developers who come in and they're ready to start, they try to log in to their laptop and they don't have access to anything. Then they spend days on the phone with the help desk. This happens to I'd say seven out of ten of the software engineers I see onboarded.\"</p> \n<h2>Why are companies hiring for these roles?</h2> \n<p>There's a range of motivations for businesses to keep onboarding people without any idea of what they'll do, added Dr. Maggiori.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The author said there is a lack of understanding of the complex work specialists were hired to do, allowing for the slow pace to continue.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There's also complicity among peers not to call out task bloating for fear they'd all be asked to do more.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;\"If someone says: 'You need to spend a few million on this to make it work', they will,\" he added.</p> \n<p>Other hiring motivators include snapping up talent when it's available to deploy when needed, but more cynically, Maggiori believed middle managers simply want bigger teams: \"The thinking is the more people you manage, the better. They want to hire to meet metrics.\"</p> \n<p>It's a theory supported by a member of the so-called <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/company/paypal-holdings/\">PayPal</a> Mafia, Silicon Valley VC Keith Rabois.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rabois, who was an executive at PayPal in the early 2000s alongside <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/company/tesla/\">Tesla</a> CEO Elon Musk, told an event hosted by banking firm <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/company/evercore/\">Evercore</a> that <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/\">Google</a> and Meta had <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/03/10/google-over-hired-talent-do-nothing-fake-work-stop-working-rivals-former-paypal-boss-keith-rabois/\">hired thousands of people to do “fake work”</a> to hit hiring metrics out of “vanity.”</p> \n<h2>What's the impact?</h2> \n<p>Getting paid six figures to do \"nothing\" might sound like the dream for some.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The reality, Maggiori said, is that it's boring and demotivating.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"If no one cares if you don't work, it makes you feel like whatever you do just doesn't matter anyway,\" he explained. \"It's not laziness, it's demotivation.\"</p> \n<p>The onus isn't on the employees but the employer to foster a spirit of proactivity, added Ignatius Nothnagel, who worked for <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/\">Amazon</a> for six years before launching his own coaching firm working with tech start-ups.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He told <em>Fortune</em> in his many years at Amazon Web Services in both South Africa and the Netherlands, he never saw staff searching for something to do.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Nothnagel said that the e-commerce giant's encouragement to staff to \"think like an owner\" pushed employees to think creatively and proactively, taking it upon themselves to find work to do.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>His experience of working at Amazon, he said, was like working at other start-ups with the end goal of making a difference.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the end of the day, Nothnagel added, businesses not making the most of talent are \"paying a very expensive person to use 1% of their brain.\"</p> \n<h2>Another side of the coin</h2> \n<p>Other sources working in the tech sector told <em>Fortune</em> their days were filled with similarly meaningless work, or simply \"doing their own thing\".&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, this is a far cry from the reality witnessed by Adam Machanic, who has worked in data roles across the U.S. financial sector for more than 20 years.</p> \n<p>He told <em>Fortune</em> in a phone interview that a lack of work sounded like a \"totally different world\" to his own.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"I've worked for various firms like start-ups and financial services,\" he said.</p> \n<p>\"In start-ups, the founder needs to get the business off the ground as quickly as possible so you all work really hard to get it there.</p> \n<p>\"Finance has never been known as a place to go and not do any work—we've always had a work hard and get rewarded for it culture.</p> \n<p>\"The idea that someone would sit there doing three hours a week is completely foreign to me.\"</p> \n<p>Machanic drew similar comparisons to Rabois, saying that tech layoffs at the likes of <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/03/14/meta-layoffs-10000-mark-zuckerberg-year-of-efficiency-hiring-freeze/\">Meta</a>, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/01/31/google-layoffs-worker-on-maternity-leave-sacked-while-feeding-newborn-at-430am/\">Google </a>and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/02/14/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-says-meeting-about-layoffs-bad-idea/\">Salesforce</a> showed how companies could survive despite shedding thousands of workers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"I've never worked in a massive organization but I can only assume it's way easier to hide,\" he said, pointing out that laziness isn't necessarily stemming from the bottom ranks of businesses, but rather for middle-managers \"delegating\" their laziness.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He added: \"It's hiding behind this wall of saying they're very busy. At smaller firms and in the hedge fund space there's just no room for that.\"</p> \n<p>This story was originally featured on <a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/04/07/tech-bank-jobs-paid-to-do-no-work/\">Fortune.com</a></p> \n<p><strong>More from Fortune:</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/recommends/banking/lucrative-side-hustles-you-can-do-from-home/?utm_source=Yahoo%21%20Finance&amp;utm_medium=promo-module-bottom&amp;utm_campaign=syndicationpromo&amp;utm_term=%27Penned%27%20tech%20specialists%20are%20earning%20six-figure%20salaries%20to%20%27do%20nothing%27%20and%20string%20out%2010-minute%20tasks.%20Some%20are%20even%20using%20the%20time%20to%20scuba%20dive\">5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/recommends/banking/what-happens-when-a-bank-fails/?utm_source=Yahoo%21%20Finance&amp;utm_medium=promo-module-bottom&amp;utm_campaign=syndicationpromo&amp;utm_term=%27Penned%27%20tech%20specialists%20are%20earning%20six-figure%20salaries%20to%20%27do%20nothing%27%20and%20string%20out%2010-minute%20tasks.%20Some%20are%20even%20using%20the%20time%20to%20scuba%20dive\">Expert advice to keep your money safe during bank failures</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\" href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/summit-powder-mountain-utopia/?utm_source=Yahoo%21%20Finance&amp;utm_medium=promo-module-bottom&amp;utm_campaign=syndicationpromo&amp;utm_term=%27Penned%27%20tech%20specialists%20are%20earning%20six-figure%20salaries%20to%20%27do%20nothing%27%20and%20string%20out%2010-minute%20tasks.%20Some%20are%20even%20using%20the%20time%20to%20scuba%20dive\">The young creators of a \"TED meets Burning Man\" conference bought a $40-million mountain.

Kroger features a leading private-label offering and manufactures around 30% of its own-brand units (and more than 40% of its grocery own-label assortment) itself, in 33 food production plants nationwide. Kroger is a top-two grocer in most of its major markets (as of early 2021, according to company data). Virtually all of Kroger's sales come from the United States.

By contrast, General Motors Co saw an 18% boost, helped by greater demand for EVs from fleet and commercial customers. </p> \n<p> U.S. consumers making the switch to electric vehicles are largely doing so from Toyota and Honda Motor Co, data from S&amp;P Global Mobility showed in November. </p> \n<p> \"Now that it is time to make the next big innovative leap, Toyota is falling behind and more and more folks in the U.S. are starting to understand that,\" East Peterson-Trujillo, a clean vehicles campaigner with nonprofit Public Citizen, said in an interview ahead of the briefing. </p> \n<p> (Reporting by Daniel Leussink and Maki Shiraki; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Clarence Fernandez) </p>",

Some are obvious, and some are not obvious—and it might be that the ones that are not obvious become more important over time,” he said. According to analysts at <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/pricewaterhousecoopers/\" target=\"_blank\">PricewaterhouseCoopers</a>, A.I. could add up to <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html\" target=\"_blank\">$15.7&nbsp;trillion</a> in global GDP in 2030, which is more than the current output from India and China combined.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>But experts caution that investing in generative A.I. is far more nuanced than just buying Big Tech stocks that have integrated the technology. “This could be another one of those moments where we’re getting to the peak of the hype cycle, so companies are going to spend the money, but they’re going to find it’s a lot harder to build something truly compelling,” explained Peter Cohan, business professor at Babson College. “<a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a> has a big investment in <a href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a>, and they also have GitHub, which has a lot of the software that can be used for developing A.I., yet I still don’t know if that’s going to generate enough revenue for Microsoft for A.I. itself to become a significant part of its business,” he noted.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>But it’s impossible to ignore that in an era of high <a href=\"https://fortune.com/tag/inflation/\" target=\"_blank\">inflation</a> and subpar index returns, companies and funds that focus on A.I. and machine learning have strong growth potential. For example, the Global&nbsp;X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ), which tracks 44 holdings of companies involved with industrial robotics and automation, nonindustrial robots, and autonomous vehicles, is up 18% year to date, while the S&amp;P&nbsp;500 is just up 7%. For investors who want to get in on this burgeoning area, here are the smartest ways to approach investing in A.I.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2943822,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} --> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2943822\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VxTgbeeOrkbfwtkZFv1H9w--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/e740a81f087676717a243ec858532ff8\" data-uuid=\"c92b23c2-92b2-38a4-b0a1-cf94372a1c7f\">\n</figure> \n<!-- /wp:image --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2>Big Tech</h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>A plethora of companies across sectors are integrating A.I. into their operations,&nbsp;from <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/12/07/land-olakes-farmers-ai-entrepreneurs-wayfair/\" target=\"_blank\">Land O’Lakes</a>&nbsp;to Microsoft to cybersecurity firm <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/01/24/meet-13-vcs-dominating-cybersecurity/\" target=\"_blank\">SentinelOne</a>. So you may already be indirectly investing in A.I. Big Tech is leading the charge from both investment and innovation standpoints. “A.I. is being defined actively by leading tech giants,” explained PitchBook tech analyst Brendan Burke, citing the leaders as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META). “Those companies have the research labs and the operational tools to bring basic innovations in A.I. algorithms to market,” he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>If you want to bet on Big Tech, Microsoft has forged ahead the furthest with its $10&nbsp;billion investment in OpenAI and the subsequent rollout of revamped search service <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/03/16/microsoft-opens-bing-chatbot-to-everyone-gpt-4-openai/\" target=\"_blank\">Bing</a> with new A.I.-powered search features. While Bing’s features have debuted with some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/02/17/microsoft-bing-search-chatgpt-openai-nyt-ai-bias-mistakes/\" target=\"_blank\">bizarre and disturbing</a> interactions with users, if the technology does successfully upend Google’s search, Microsoft has a huge market share to gain. “We believe incorporating <a href=\"https://fortune.com/tag/chatgpt/\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> capabilities into Bing may provide Microsoft with a once-a-decade opportunity to unseat Google’s Search dominance,” wrote D.A. Davidson software analyst Gil Luria in a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/01/10/microsoft-openai-10-billion-alphabet-google-chatgpt-generative-ai/\" target=\"_blank\">recent research note</a>. Luria increased Microsoft’s price target from $270 to $325 and gave the firm a buy rating. “While <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> has announced a project to add [generative] A.I. to Google Search, we believe Bing’s head start could create a permanent share shift,” Luria wrote. Yet with the speed bumps in the rollout of Bing, it is clear that generative A.I. chatbots still have a long way to go.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":3528894,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} --> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Chart shows AI-focused fund performances y-t-d\" class=\"wp-image-3528894\" src=\"https://s1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/unvz8amQVbK9gvgJtrHYvA--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/571fd3e9843b45ffbffee0561f636e8e\" data-uuid=\"c42e2ea3-2fbb-3dfb-966c-7de6349c5552\">\n <figcaption>\n  Chart shows AI-focused fund performances y-t-d\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<!-- /wp:image --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/bank-of-america-corp/\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America</a> analysts, on the other hand, wrote in a recent report that Meta’s stock has the most to gain from A.I. implementation, citing the company’s incorporation of A.I. into its Reels video feature. “We expect an outsized impact from the adoption of A.I. given rich consumer data sets and massive ramp-up in A.I. investments, led by Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon,” the report detailed. Bank of America gave Alphabet and Amazon buy ratings&nbsp;in its forward-looking 2023 report.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Comparing the A.I. boom to the dotcom&nbsp;boom of the early 2000s,&nbsp;it is clear that if you pick the right companies you can still make out very well. “Even if you bought&nbsp;Amazon at the height of the dotcom boom, you&nbsp;still would have made a&nbsp;lot of money,” said Tom Taulli, a startup advisor and A.I. author.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>But the giants have a problem—they’re huge. “It’s harder to move the needle for [Big Tech] as opposed to some of these smaller or midsize companies that are going to wind up playing in space that is going to be significant,” Helfstein said. “Maybe they won’t be as recognizable, but they have better growth potential, which can turn into investment returns,” explained Helfstein.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2943822,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} --> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2943822\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VxTgbeeOrkbfwtkZFv1H9w--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/e740a81f087676717a243ec858532ff8\" data-uuid=\"c92b23c2-92b2-38a4-b0a1-cf94372a1c7f\">\n</figure> \n<!-- /wp:image --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2>The “picks and shovels” of the A.I. boom</h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>During the California gold rush, some of the savviest investors eschewed chasing gold itself and made a mint investing in the picks and shovels that those looking for riches needed for their search. Cohan sees an analogy in A.I. “It might well be that the initial beneficiaries of A.I. expansion are going to be in the hardware space, instead of the software space,” Helfstein predicted.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>So what “picks” do experts recommend? PitchBook’s Burke explained: “A.I. growth is based on the improved efficiency and the decreased cost of [graphics] processing units (GPUs). The most basic enabler for these new models is the latest hardware innovations coming from chip giants such as <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/intel/\" target=\"_blank\">Intel</a> (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia</a> (NVDA).” Semiconductors are necessary for A.I.&nbsp;software to function, and the companies that produce them will supercharge its expansion.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Nvidia is currently the leading chip producer in the A.I. space. “A lot of capital is going to go into these generative A.I. startups,” said Cohan. “And the question for investors is: What technology will they be using to build their APIs? The answer is that they’re very likely to be using <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/03/28/nvidia-moves-into-a-i-services-and-chatgpt-can-now-use-your-credit-card/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia chips</a>.” &nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:pullquote --> \n<figure>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>“It’s the early days in terms of picking winners and losers.”</p>\n  <cite>Scott Helfstein, head of thematic solutions at Global&nbsp;X ETFs</cite>\n </blockquote>\n</figure> \n<!-- /wp:pullquote --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Beyond chips, there is software infrastructure to support the huge volume of data that the A.I. explosion will rely on. “The next layer up, there’s a need for enterprises to integrate their data into centralized data warehouses to improve the performance of their A.I. models,” Burke explained. “That’s where database management vendors, such as <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/09/15/snowflake-ipo-database-oracle-frank-slootman/\" target=\"_blank\">Snowflake</a> (SNOW) and Alteryx (AYX) can help enterprises,” he said. Zacks gives&nbsp;both companies buy ratings.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Dynatrace (DT) is another cloud-computing infrastructure firm that could have upside. The company operates a software intelligence platform that uses A.I. and automation. Bank of America thinks the stock, which is up 1% year to date, has further to run, giving it a buy rating.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Another winner could be Palantir Technologies (PLTR), which is projected to increase its market share and revenue as one of its biggest clients, the U.S. government, expands its military A.I. implementation. In October 2022, the company signed an $85&nbsp;million contract with the U.S. Army Materiel Command to use its software to increase military A.I. capabilities. The company was founded in 2003 by a group of VCs including Peter Thiel, Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp. While the stock is up 31% year to date, analysts (like those at BofA who have a “buy” rating on the stock) expect it can further capitalize on the A.I. boom.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2943822,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} --> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2943822\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VxTgbeeOrkbfwtkZFv1H9w--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/e740a81f087676717a243ec858532ff8\" data-uuid=\"c92b23c2-92b2-38a4-b0a1-cf94372a1c7f\">\n</figure> \n<!-- /wp:image --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2>A.I.-focused funds&nbsp;</h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Though A.I. technology has had a breakthrough year, there are already a robust number of funds and ETFs that give you exposure to the sector, which is a win for investors. “With these emerging technologies, people are better off playing a basket of companies, rather than putting their chips in a single one,” said Helfstein. He drew a comparison to <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/tesla/\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla</a> in the electric vehicle industry. While Tesla was first out of the gate to dominate the EV market, competitors are now lining up to surpass the reigning EV king: “I don’t think we’re gonna live in a world that’s dominated by a single A.I.—it’s going to be a competitive market.” Not to mention the inherent unpredictability of an industry evolving at warp speed. “This can be a volatile space; you never know what could happen tomorrow, so diversification is important,” explained Taulli.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>A solid option is the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF&nbsp;(BOTZ), which is up 18% year to date and has $1.64&nbsp;billion in assets under management. Its top holdings include Nvidia, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/intuitive-surgical/\" target=\"_blank\">Intuitive Surgical</a>, Upstart Holdings (UPST), Keyence (KYCCF), and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/abb/\" target=\"_blank\">ABB</a> (ABB).&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>BlackRock’s&nbsp;iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector&nbsp;ETF (IRBO) is another option, which has 118 holdings and around $288&nbsp;million in assets under management.

If you go into the multi-family business, rents maybe softening a little bit, but there's still an undersupply of housing. The elephant in the room is office space, that’s going through a transformative shift.”</p> \n<p>When it comes to office loans, since 2021, 44% more by volume were in delinquency and 55% more were in special servicing, according to Trepp, a&nbsp;provider of data and insights on commercial real estate.</p> \n<p>\"Storm clouds&nbsp;are absolutely building,\" says Grinis.</p> \n<h2 class=\"presto-h2\">Private equity to the rescue of&nbsp;office buildings?</h2> \n<p>In the short term, poorly structured, capitalized and financed buildings are probably either undergo some sort of change of ownership or go through foreclosure,&nbsp;says Grinis.</p> \n<p>“You're gonna see some eggs broken as these things (mortgages)&nbsp;mature and come due,” says Grinis.&nbsp;“And they either have to find somebody that'll give them additional equity capital, they have to get their lender to be flexible or it will go back to the bank.”</p> \n<p>When the price is right, expect private capital to step in.</p> \n<p>“It’s a publicly traded security and a lot of people are looking at some of these office stocks and saying, ‘God, these are a pretty good buy,” so private equity will, at some point when the price is right, be there.”</p> \n<h2 class=\"presto-h2\">Perspective from a&nbsp;real estate firm</h2> \n<p>Kip Sowden, CEO of Dallas-based RREAF Holdings, a private real estate investment firm with $5 billion in assets under management, says he’s seen business shrink due to tighter lending requirements.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Kip Sowden\" height=\"2000\" id=\"11624774002\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/467rvjIN7k_7JqA2xt5_lQ--/cT03NTthcHBpZD15dmlkZW9mZWVkczs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_money_325/2f6c030fab76e0095eb8d5613668447f\" width=\"1334\" data-uuid=\"261f5867-77fe-34e5-98cf-2c172388d14c\"></p> \n<p>&nbsp;The company, which operates in 14 states, develops multi-family dwellings, beachfront resorts, large residential communities, extended stay hotels and is in the process of developing RV parks.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In 2022, the company exceeded $1.5 billion in deal volume, up from $1.3 billion in 2021, he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;“And in 2023, we think those numbers will likely be cut in half because of higher interest rates and just contraction in the number of deals financial institutions will look to fund.”</p> \n<p>Sowden, who borrows from regional banks, says underwriting requirements have become very stringent.</p> \n<p>“ A lot more equity is necessary to transact than before,” he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2 class=\"presto-h2\">Office-to-residential conversions are top of mind</h2> \n<p>Office –to–residential conversions have been a hot topic of discussion ever since the pandemic emptied out office buildings.</p> \n<p>State and local officials can help developers stuck with languishing properties while addressing affordable housing challenges in cities by fast-tracking zoning changes required for these conversions, say experts.</p> \n<p>“Cities like New York and San Francisco are jewels of urban landscape and nobody benefits when these urban centers suffer,” says Grinis. &nbsp;\"And so, there's a call to action with respect to governments, private capital and then to maybe to some extent, regulators and legislators to ensure that the vibrancy of cities continue.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"exclude-from-newsgate\"><em>Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a&nbsp;housing and economy correspondent&nbsp;for USA TODAY.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can&nbsp;follow her on Twitter @SwapnaVenugopal&nbsp;and sign up for our&nbsp;Daily Money newsletter&nbsp;here.</em></span></p> \n<p><em>This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/real-estate/2023/04/07/commercial-real-estate-price-drop-morgan-stanley-report/11620997002/\">Morgan Stanley commercial real estate report predicts steep price drop</a></em></p>",

Diversification across tax location, investment type, time horizon and goals will help optimize your retirement portfolio.</p> \n<p>Start by assessing your \"sleep-well-at-night meter.\" Your risk tolerance may or may not match the risk you need to maintain purchasing power and growth. Maximizing for factors such as growth can help you meet your longevity and medical expense needs.</p> \n<p>Second, select fundamental investments that meet your foundational lifestyle needs, commonly called your core portfolio. For example, three to four low-cost, diversified index or <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/investing/what-are-exchange-traded-funds-etfs\">exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> may suit your core portfolio across equities, bonds and domestic and international investments.</p> \n<p>Your market equity participation will depend on how much guaranteed income coverage you have from resources such as <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/what-is-social-security\">Social Security</a> and your risk tolerance.</p> \n<p>If you have the capacity and resources to accept volatility and risk for potential additional growth opportunities, consider adding speculative assets to your portfolio, such as gold and cryptocurrencies, and take advantage of bear market corrections.</p> \n<p>Let's dive a bit more into each of these categories of lifestyle and risk considerations.&nbsp;(If you have additional questions about investing or retirement, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisorstructuremyportfolio\">this tool can help match you with potential advisors</a>.)</p> \n<strong>Longevity</strong> \n<p>Although Americans' average life expectancy has taken a hit in recent years, they still enjoy long retirements by historical standards. The average life expectancy is approximately 80 years&nbsp;for women and 74 for men, respectively, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These are averages, meaning retirement can span 25 to 35 years. Longer time spent in retirement requires more funding, and more funding requires a balance of conservation and growth.</p> \n<p>If your <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/investing/investment-calculator\">investment</a> selections are too conservative, they may not provide the growth necessary to accommodate your potential longevity. Consequently, if selections are too aggressive, there is a risk of poor extended performance contributing to a longevity shortfall.&nbsp;(If you have additional questions about investing or retirement, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisorstructuremyportfolio\">this tool can help match you with potential advisors</a>.)</p> \n<strong>Lifestyle Needs and Preferences</strong> \n<p><a href=\"https://dr5dymrsxhdzh.cloudfront.net/blog/images/a1328eee0/2023/04/businesswoman-working-on-laptop-computer-analyzing-sales-data-and-economic-growth-graph-chart.jpg_s1024x1024wisk20cKnnLUzeutJIl5G1pPYwZ2woFUDN0TWNXoOWOG1xas48.jpg\"><img alt=\"Ask an Advisor: I'm 65 Years Old and Going to Retire Soon.

If your lifestyle preferences require higher levels of funding, your investment selection may orient more toward growth.</p> \n<p>You may have <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/how-to-financially-prepare-for-retirement-travel\">travel aspirations</a>, be philanthropic, have wealth transference goals and have higher daily lifestyle standards, all of which require a tilt toward growth. Contrarily, more reserved lifestyle preferences will shift your investment selections toward a more balanced, conservative growth approach.</p> \n<p>Fundamental care and needs must be met during retirement. Medical expenses during retirement and long-term care support and services toward the end of life are expensive. These services require a combination of public or private insurance protection with private funding supplements.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/what-does-medicare-coverhttps://smartasset.com/retirement/what-does-medicare-cover\">Medicare</a> supports a vast amount of medical care beginning at age 65, yet it leaves gaps in coverage that require money. If <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/insurance/what-is-long-term-care-insurance-and-do-you-need-it\">long-term care insurance</a> has been purchased approaching 65, premiums are expensive, meaning self-funding. Current and long-term care coverage, need and resources will influence portfolio construction.&nbsp;(If you have additional questions about investing or retirement, <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisorstructuremyportfolio\">this tool can help match you with potential advisors</a>.)</p> \n<strong>Risk Capacity and Tolerance</strong> \n<p>Risk capacity is your ability to take investment risk, and risk tolerance is your willingness to take that risk. Both forms of risk evaluation will influence your retirement planning and the structure of your retirement portfolio. When considering risk capacity, you must consider your other available financial resources, which affect your risk tolerance.</p> \n<p>Other financial resources such as Social Security and a pension, private annuity, or income streams from real estate properties will factor in how much risk you can accept in your market portfolio. For example, Social Security, pensions and private annuities are guaranteed income streams that fund a certain percentage of essential lifestyle needs over time.</p> \n<p>The presence of fixed resources reduces the retirement funding need with additional market resources. It increases the risk capacity you can accept to foster growth in your portfolio to combat <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/investing/inflation-calculator\">inflation</a> and longevity risk. Furthermore, you may not need to replicate income types in the market if abundant resources mirror income.</p> \n<p>Risk tolerance also includes your emotional ability to sleep well at night during periods of market volatility. The economic and financial markets are cyclical and fluctuate. While additional risk could foster more growth opportunities, more risk also welcomes more volatility during hostile market times. Growth <a href=\"https://smartasset.com/investing/asset-allocation-calculator\">allocation</a> is not to be feared. However, it is to be accounted for both economically and emotionally.</p> \n<strong>Bottom Line</strong> \n<p>The structure of your retirement portfolio will depend on your risk tolerance, needs, lifestyle and other factors. Consider evaluating those considerations as you approach portfolio design.</p> \n<b>Tips for Finding a Financial Advisor</b> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisorstructuremyportfolio\">Finding a financial advisor</a>&nbsp;doesn't have to be hard.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&amp;utm_content=askanadvisorstructuremyportfolio\">SmartAsset's free tool</a>&nbsp;matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.

While they guess it will take $1.1 million for a comfortable retirement, only 21% foresee hitting that benchmark, down from 24% when the survey asked that question last year.</p> \n<p>The results add to the many data points showing how far behind workers feel when it comes to saving for retirement and underscore how crucial it is for Americans to redouble their efforts to save more.</p> \n<p>“American workers are losing ground on retirement readiness and increasing the risk of outliving their assets,” Deb Boyden, Schroders’s head of U.S. defined contribution, told Yahoo Finance. “Collectively, we all need to do more to help improve the savings and retirement security of American workers.</p> \n<div id=\"7470ae1bdb354336a9d639576655c961\"></div> \n<h2><strong>‘Likely needing to make modest to significant adjustments’</strong></h2> \n<p>Many predict they’ll sock away less than half of what’s needed, according to the Schroders survey of 2,000 workers between the ages 27 and 79 conducted earlier this year.</p> \n<p>Nearly half of millennials (49%) said they’ll accrue less than $500,000 for retirement, including 27% who said they’ll likely have less than $250,000.

Few workers have run the numbers to determine how much they’ll need in retirement.</p> \n<p>The question is a deviling one for certain, but just 46% of workers have even tried to calculate how much money they will need to pay for living expenses in retirement, down from 50% in 2021, according to a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ebri.org/docs/default-source/webinars/rcswebinar.pdf?sfvrsn=603c382f_4\">survey from the nonpartisan Employment Benefits Research Institute (EBRI)</a>, which surveyed 1,545 workers.</p> \n<p>“Determining how much you need for retirement is important,” Christine Benz, Morningstar’s director of personal finance and retirement planning, told Yahoo Finance. “So, it pays to spend some time crunching the numbers on how much you’ll actually need and how much you can reasonably spend each year in retirement.”</p> \n<p>Benz suggests reaching out to an hourly, fee-only financial planner for help, or at least use a “good-quality retirement calculator or two.” Check out <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.aarp.org/work/retirement-planning/retirement_calculator.html\">AARP</a>, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Retirement_calculators_and_spending#Free_retirement_calculators\">Bogleheads</a>, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://digital.fidelity.com/stgw/digital/planning/retirement/retirement-income-calculator/\">Fidelity</a>, or <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://retirementplans.vanguard.com/VGApp/pe/pubeducation/calculators/RetirementNestEggCalc.jsf\">Vanguard</a> on that front to start.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The problem of expectation versus reality for retirement savings is also exacerbated by the fact that most people retire earlier than they had thought they would, which means more years to finance with savings.</p> \n<p>Moreover, most Americans <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/166000-to-197000-new-estimates-for-retirement-health-care-costs-may-be-too-low-145143699.html\">underestimate</a> their health care costs in retirement, and that’s a quandary because those future bills may turn out to be considerably higher than you expect.</p> \n<h2><strong>How to catch up</strong></h2> \n<p>For the two-thirds (69%) of U.S. private-sector workers with access to a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2023/retirement-plans-for-workers-in-private-industry-and-state-and-local-government-in-2022.htm\">workplace retirement savings plan</a>, the time is now to accelerate your savings habits.</p> \n<p>“In general, we recommend people aim to save at least 15% of their pre-retirement income each year, which includes any employer match, with a goal to save 10 times your pre-retirement income by age 67,” Assaf said. To get a sense of how that plays out, think if it as 1x your [current] income by age 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, and 8x by 60, she added.</p> \n<p>Those who can’t afford to increase their savings rate to the recommended 15% should just get started, even if it is a small amount. Bumping your retirement savings up 1% more each year can have a “tremendous impact in the long term,” she said. The math: For a household making $60,000, 1% equals saving an extra $50 a month. “That could translate into an additional $270 of monthly retirement income with compound interest and market growth,” Assaf said.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-04/50831ee0-d54a-11ed-addf-bec28d3956f6\" alt=\"Fidelity's 2023 Retirement Savings Assessment\" data-uuid=\"ed2b7011-741e-3407-b470-ae8a3d039f0c\">\n <figcaption>\n  Fidelity's 2023 Retirement Savings Assessment\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Fidelity's 2023 Retirement Savings Assessment\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>And if you are considering changing jobs this year, steer clear of the temptation to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/efforts-to-keep-workers-from-cashing-out-their-401-ks-gain-steam-181832994.html\">cash out some or all of your retirement accounts</a> — something 41.4% of <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mksc.2022.1404\">workers between 2014 and 2016 did</a>. A whopping 85% emptied their balance.</p> \n<p>For younger workers, it’s also important to tune out the day-to-day, month-to-month, and even year-to-year ups and downs in the market. For instance, as equity and bond markets dropped in 2022, average participant account balances decreased by 20% from year-end 2021, according to a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https://institutional.vanguard.com/insights-and-research/perspective/a-preview-of-how-america-saves-2023.html\">recent Vanguard report</a>.</p> \n<p>That could make anyone nervous, but as Boyden said: “Markets will always sway, but those who develop and stick to a plan will put themselves in the best position possible to enjoy a comfortable retirement.”</p> \n<p>And for people who are getting close to retirement with fewer years to save and concerned they won’t have enough, it’s worthwhile to look at all of the ways they can catch up.</p> \n<p>“These levers include delaying retirement, turbocharging retirement savings in the years leading up to retirement, reducing expenses — especially through high-impact changes like relocation or downsizing — delaying <a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/workers-must-plan-on-social-security-shortfall-when-retirement-planning-advisers-say-203114970.html\">Social Security</a>, considering an annuity, and so on,” Benz said. “It may be that several incremental changes rather than one or two big, sweeping ones can help make a retirement plan add up.”</p> \n<p><em>Kerry is a Senior Reporter and Columnist at Yahoo Finance.
